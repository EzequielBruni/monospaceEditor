# MonospaceEditor for Typemill

This dead-simple plugin for Typemill (based on the darkadmin plugin by Sebastian Sch√ºrmanns) makes the raw Markdown editor use your system-or-browser-defined monospace font.

Now if only I was smart enough to implement EasyMDE, or some other plugin to provide syntax highlighting and a few keyboard shortcuts.
